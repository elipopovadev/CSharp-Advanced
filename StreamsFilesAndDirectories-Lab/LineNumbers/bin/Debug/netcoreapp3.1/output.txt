1Two households, both alike in dignity,
2In fair Verona, where we lay our scene,
3From ancient grudge break to new mutiny,
4Where civil blood makes civil hands unclean.
5From forth the fatal loins of these two foes
6A pair of star-cross&#39;d lovers take their life;
7Whose misadventured piteous overthrows
8Do with their death bury their parents&#39; strife.
